Hi #{h(@attendance.full_name)},

%p Tomorrow is an agile day. =)

%p You should remember to:

%ul
  %li Bring a valid document
  - if @attendance.to_pay_the_difference?
    %li= "* Your group does not reached the minimum and you need to pay the full price in the event's day. You've paid R$#{number_to_currency(@attendance.registration_value)} and the current price is R$#{number_to_currency(@attendance.event.full_price)}"
  %li If you are registered as student, youâ€™ll be invited to comprove it by show your student id. You'll be asked to pay the full price if you don't have it.
  %li The welcome coffee and the registration will be in place at #{@attendance.event.start_date.to_date.strftime('%H:%M')}
  %li Check #{@attendance.event.link} for address and how to get there details.

%p We came to know some issues around hailing Uber cars from Campinas airport. We highly recommend that you hail a cab instead or arrange alternative ways of getting to the conference venue without getting delayed. We apologise for the inconvenience this may cause.
%p If you have any questions, please contact us at #{mail_to @attendance.event.main_email_contact}

%p See you there
