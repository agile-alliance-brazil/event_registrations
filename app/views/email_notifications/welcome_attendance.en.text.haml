Hi #{h(@attendance.full_name)},

Tomorrow is an agile day. =)

You should remember to:


* Bring a valid document
- if @attendance.to_pay_the_difference?
  = "* Your group does not reached the minimum and you need to pay the full price in the event's day. You've paid R$#{number_to_currency(@attendance.registration_value)} and the current price is R$#{number_to_currency(@attendance.event.full_price)}"
* If you are registered as student, youâ€™ll be invited to comprove it showing your student id. You'll be asked to pay the full price if you don't have it.
* The welcome coffee and the registration will be in place at #{@attendance.event.start_date.to_date.strftime('%H:%M')}
* Check #{@attendance.event.link} for address and how to get there details.

We came to know some issues around hailing Uber cars from Campinas airport. We highly recommend that you hail a cab instead or arrange alternative ways of getting to the conference venue without getting delayed. We apologise for the inconvenience this may cause.

If you have any questions, please contact us at #{mail_to @attendance.event.main_email_contact}

See you there
