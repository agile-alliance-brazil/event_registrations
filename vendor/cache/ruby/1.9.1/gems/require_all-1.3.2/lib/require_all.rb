module RequireAll
  # A wonderfully simple way to load your code.
  #
  # The easiest way to use require_all is to just point it at a directory
  # containing a bunch of .rb files.  These files can be nested under 
  # subdirectories as well:
  #
  #  require_all 'lib'
  #
  # This will find all the .rb files under the lib directory and load them.
  # The proper order to load them in will be determined automatically.
  #
  # If the dependencies between the matched files are unresolvable, it will 
  # throw the first unresolvable NameError.
  #
  # You can also give it a glob, which will enumerate all the matching files: 
  #
  #  require_all 'lib/**/*.rb'
  #
  # It will also accept an array of files:
  #
  #  require_all Dir.glob("blah/**/*.rb").reject { |f| stupid_file(f) }
  # 
  # Or if you want, just list the files directly as arguments:
  #
  #  require_all 'lib/a.rb', 'lib/b.rb', 'lib/c.rb', 'lib/d.rb'
  #
  def require_all(*args)
    # Handle passing an array as an argument

  # Performs Kernel#autoload on all of the files rather than requiring immediately.
  #
  # Note that all Ruby files inside of the specified directories should have same module name as
  # the directory itself and file names should reflect the class/module names.
  # For example if there is a my_file.rb in directories dir1/dir2/ then
  # there should be a declaration like this in my_file.rb:
  #   module Dir1
  #     module Dir2
  #       class MyFile
  #         ...
  #       end
  #     end
  #  end
  #
  # If the filename and namespaces won't match then my_file.rb will be loaded into wrong module!
  # Better to fix these files.
  #
  # Set $DEBUG=true to see how files will be autoloaded if experiencing any problems.
  #
  # If trying to perform autoload on some individual file or some inner module, then you'd have
  # to always specify *:base_dir* option to specify where top-level namespace resides.
  # Otherwise it's impossible to know the namespace of the loaded files.
  #
  # For example loading only my_file.rb from dir1/dir2 with autoload_all:
  #
  #   autoload_all File.dirname(__FILE__) + '/dir1/dir2/my_file',
  #                :base_dir => File.dirname(__FILE__) + '/dir1'
  #
  # WARNING: All modules will be created even if files themselves aren't loaded yet, meaning
  # that all the code which depends of the modules being loaded or not will not work, like usages
  # of define? and it's friends.
  #
  # Also, normal caveats of using Kernel#autoload apply - you have to remember that before
  # applying any monkey-patches to code using autoload, you'll have to reference the full constant
  # to load the code before applying your patch!
